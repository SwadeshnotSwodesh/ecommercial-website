		<h2>Welcome To Our Site</h2><p>I am Ben Carling, the owner and head coach at Sports Performance Services Ltd, based in Douglas, Isle of Man. After studying business management, I decided embark in a career that was also a passion of mine; health and fitness. I had played sports from an early age so it seemed a natural thing to do. I became a qualified Personal Trainer, and latterly an accredited Strength and Conditioning coach with the UKSCA. Currently there are only 4 accredited coaches in the Isle of Man, and circa 600 in the UK.<br>As well as private work, I work at the Isle of Man Sport Institute. I work with a wide cross section of athletes from different sports, from field based sports such as football, rugby and hockey to individual sports such as archery, sailing, tennis, motorsport and swimming. I am proud to have played my part in helping these athletes set personal bests, Island records and some that have gone on to achieve scholarships or youth contracts at professional level.<br><br>
		<h4>OUR PHILOSOPHY!</h4><br>
		<ul>
			<li> To provide innovative, enthusiastic and professional coaching!</li>
			<li> To focus on the specific needs of the athlete and their sport and/or training goals!</li>
